This article was inspired by a visit that the author made to a museum in the 

Norwegian region of Ingenmannslandfjorden.

The museum has a display of items found at a nearby Viking grave.

While these items seem like ordinary Viking weaponry and armour,

closer inspection reveals a design that is far more subtle and displays a

remarkable understanding of topology and geometry.
